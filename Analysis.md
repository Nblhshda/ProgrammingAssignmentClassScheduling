# 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Central Processing Unit (CPU) Scheduling is a process made to finish the work on time. In a multiprogramming system, CPU scheduling is needed to manage both Input/Output (IO) and CPU time. While these are the core of computer processing, there are many algorithms available to execute the scheduling process. In this project, we are testing out three algorithms of CPU scheduling that are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling and perform an analysis to differentiate between these algorithms in terms of CPU key processes..
# 2.0 CONSIDERATION

The scheduling algorithms that we considered in this project are First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), and Priority Scheduling. All of the algorithms that we considered are non-preemptive. We applied processes with the same input such as burst time, priority, and arrival time to evaluate the average waiting time and average turnaround time. Then, with the results, we analyse which one of those three (FCFS scheduling algorithm, SJF scheduling algorithm, and Priority Scheduling) is the better algorithm and optimum best class scheduling.  

# 3.0 ANALYSIS
## 3.1 INPUT

We initialize the same input in an array proc[] by using the structure name Course for the three algorithms which is given as the following:

struct Course

{

   int ccode;     // course code
   
   int duration;      // class duration
   
   int priority;  //priority
   
   int arrival_time;   //prefered arrival time
   
};

Course proc[] = {{ccode, duration, priority, arrival_time},...};

Course proc[] = {{2201,3,2,0}, {3401, 5, 6,2}, {1103,4,3,1}, {2302,2,5,4},{2602,9,7,6},{3102,4,4,5},{2011,10,10,7}};

| Course Code | Burst Time  | Priority | Arrival Time |
|-------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 2201        | 3           | 2        | 0            |
| 3401        | 5           | 6        | 2            |
| 1103        | 4           | 3        | 1            |
| 2302        | 2           | 5        | 4            |
| 2602        | 9           | 7        | 6            |
| 3102        | 4           | 4        | 5            |

          Table 1 Initialized input of the algorithms

# 4.0 CONCLUSION
As a conclusion of our research, we can say that FCFS is the best algorithm and best optimum class scheduling as the SJF  is better in minimizing the average waiting time thus resulting in a more effective and higher performance compared to the other two algorithms. The SJF is better if the process comes to a processor simultaneously and can minimize the waiting time. SJF can also lead to higher effectiveness to the systems due to the lower average waiting time. However, it may happen that long processes may never be processed by the system and may remain in the queue for a long period.  As for the FCFS, it is easy to understand and implement, however it is poor in performance as their average waiting time is the highest than the rest class scheduling thus can leads to convoy effect. Convoy effect will eventually result in lower device or CPU utilization and lower efficiency. As for the priority scheduling, it is best suited for real-time operating systems, however, it may happen that a low priority process would keep waiting for an indefinite time and never get executed as the systems keep executing the high priority processes.
